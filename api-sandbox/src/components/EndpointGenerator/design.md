1) High-level UI: one screen, multiple panels

Use a single-page layout with clear, composable panels so a user can go from idea → working code in seconds.


Auth method picker (OAuth token, API key header, None).

Language preference (TS/JS, Python, Go, curl) — used to prioritize code snippets.

“Generate” button (runs the prompt).

Main grid (responsive)

Left column (narrow, ~30%): Prompt + Intent parse

Big text input. Under input: parsed intent bullets (what the system understood), confidence score, patchable interpreted params (e.g., user: :username, fields: name, description, stars).

Center column (wide, ~45%): Flow Canvas & Overview

Top: short NL summary generated by the model: “List public repos for a user, include latest commit SHA and star count.”

Middle: interactive flow diagram (sequence / DAG) visualizing steps (e.g., “GET /users/{user}/repos → GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?per_page=1”). Click a node to open details in right column.

Use React Flow or Mermaid for rendering; nodes are draggable and collapsible.

Bottom: high-level checklist (auth required, pagination, rate-limiting, expected data volume).

Right column (narrow, ~25%): Endpoint cards & Code

One card per endpoint step. Each card has:

Method & path (big), small human-friendly description, required scopes/headers

Parameter table (path/query/body) with inferred types and sample values.

Example Request (curl) + one-click copy, Run (if user has provided auth) → show live response.

Example Response (mocked) with “Generate TypeScript interfaces / Pydantic models” button.

“Export” menu: Add to collection, Export OpenAPI fragment, Export Postman, Create mock server.

Tabs inside the card: Examples | Code | Docs (link to official docs) | Errors & Pagination patterns.

Footer / Actions row

One-click: “Export OpenAPI”, “Generate SDK (TS)”, “Create sample repo (GitHub)”, “Mock server”.

Undo / Re-generate variations (model outputs n variations).

2) What the output should look like (UX principles)

Structured, deterministic: Model must return a strict JSON (see schema below). UI only accepts that JSON to render — no freeform HTML parsing.

Actionable code-first: Every endpoint card includes runnable snippets for several languages, plus USB: “one-click scaffold” that produces a small repo with sample code using that snippet.

Editable & Recoverable: Allow users to tweak parsed params (edit path param names, set default values) and re-generate diffs between versions.

Portable exports: OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman collection, and single-file snippets (index.ts, main.py) generated from the same canonical JSON.

Confidence & provenance: For each suggested endpoint show confidence and the model rationale (which doc or pattern it used), plus links to the official docs if relevant.

3) Unique differentiators (what will make it stand out)

Blueprint Cards — compressed, copyable JSON "blueprints" for each flow step. Users drag them to a workspace to build larger flows.

One-click Project Scaffolding — generate a mini repo (TS/Express or Python/FastAPI) with routes, types, and sample tests that consume the endpoints (use templates).

API Response → DB/ORM mapping — generate suggested DB schemas or ORM models (TypeORM, Prisma, SQLAlchemy) from the response schema.

Mock Server + Playground — spin up a mock server with generated routes and example responses; run code snippets against that mock in-browser.

Change-diff Narratives — when user changes the prompt, show a natural-language “what changed in the flow” summary and updated endpoints.

Cost & Rate Estimator — estimate how many calls/writes this flow needs, warn about rate limits or pagination.

Audit & Security checks — flag endpoints that require elevated scopes or return sensitive data.

4) The machine-readable output schema the model should return

Require the model to emit this JSON structure exactly. The UI is then pure rendering + tooling around it.

Make the model always produce this exact structure. If any field is unknown, the model should set it to null not drop it.
